✅ **Docker Compose**: Working, container healthy
⏸️ **Go Module**: Ready to create in Stage 2
⏸️ **oapi-codegen**: Will install in Stage 2

### Implementation Decisions Made:
- Using PostgreSQL with GORM AutoMigrate for simplicity
- Using oapi-codegen for API code generation from OpenAPI spec
- Using mark3labs/mcp-go library (same as obs-mcp)
- **Using Chi router for HTTP server** with full middleware stack
- **Chi middleware**: Logger, Recoverer, CORS, RequestID, Render
- **oapi-codegen chi-server**: Generate Chi-compatible handlers
- Skipping authentication for POC (localhost only)
- Using environment variables with defaults for configuration

### Design Validation Required:
After each stage, validate implementation against design documents and update this progress file.

### Known Potential Issues:
- oapi-codegen x-go-type extensions compatibility with GORM tags
- Natural language parsing accuracy for MCP tools
- Change tracking complexity for collateral widget movements

### Success Criteria for POC:
- User can say "remove the chart widget" → system finds and removes chart
- User can say "make the table larger" → system identifies table and increases size
- User can say "move sales chart to top right" → system finds chart and calculates position
- User can say "change filters to show only critical systems" → system updates widget props
- All operations return complete change tracking for UI synchronization
